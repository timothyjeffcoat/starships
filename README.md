Star Wars Star Ships Are Us! Come buy a star ship from us.

My plan is to get heroku instance running for online demo purpose but in the mean time try to run it yourself .

Dependencies

1. Java 8
2. Maven 3

Build instructions

1. git clone https://github.com/timothyjeffcoat/starships.git

2. cd starships

3. mvn clean install

4. mvn package

Run instructions

1. java -jar ./target/starships-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

2 then view open your browser to  localhost:8080 and wait a few seconds as it retrieves full list of ships!

Additional items left to be done

1. create rest controllers
2. use react.js for front end
